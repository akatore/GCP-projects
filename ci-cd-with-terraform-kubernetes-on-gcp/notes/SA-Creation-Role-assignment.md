You can create a Service Account (SA), assign roles to it, and create role bindings using the `gcloud` command-line tool. You have the option to utilize predefined roles or create custom roles. Here's how to do both:

### 1. **Create a Service Account**

To create a service account, use the following command:

```bash
gcloud iam service-accounts create [SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAME] \
  --description="[DESCRIPTION]" \
  --display-name="[DISPLAY_NAME]" \
  --project="[PROJECT_ID]"
```

### Replace the placeholders:
- `[SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAME]`: A name for your service account (e.g., `my-service-account`).
- `[DESCRIPTION]`: A description of what the service account is used for (e.g., `Service account for application access`).
- `[DISPLAY_NAME]`: A user-friendly name for the service account (e.g., `My Service Account`).
- `[PROJECT_ID]`: The ID of your Google Cloud project.

### Example

```bash
gcloud iam service-accounts create my-service-account \
  --description="Service account for application access" \
  --display-name="My Service Account" \
  --project="my-project"
```

### 2. **Assign Roles to the Service Account**

You can assign predefined roles or custom roles to the service account. To do this, use the following command:

```bash
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding [PROJECT_ID] \
  --member='serviceAccount:[SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL]' \
  --role='roles/[ROLE_NAME]'
```

### Replace the placeholders:
- `[SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL]`: The email of the service account you just created (usually in the format `[SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAME]@[PROJECT_ID].iam.gserviceaccount.com`).
- `[ROLE_NAME]`: The role you want to assign (e.g., `roles/viewer`, `roles/editor`).

### Example

Assuming your service account email is `my-service-account@my-project.iam.gserviceaccount.com`, to assign the Viewer role:

```bash
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding my-project \
  --member='serviceAccount:my-service-account@my-project.iam.gserviceaccount.com' \
  --role='roles/viewer'
```

### 3. **Create Custom Roles (Optional)**

If you need to create a custom role, you can do so using the following command:

```bash
gcloud iam roles create [ROLE_NAME] \
  --project="[PROJECT_ID]" \
  --title="[ROLE_TITLE]" \
  --description="[ROLE_DESCRIPTION]" \
  --permissions="[PERMISSION_1],[PERMISSION_2],..." \
  --stage="GA"
```

### Replace the placeholders:
- `[ROLE_NAME]`: A name for the custom role (e.g., `MyCustomRole`).
- `[ROLE_TITLE]`: A user-friendly title for the role (e.g., `My Custom Role`).
- `[ROLE_DESCRIPTION]`: A description of the role's purpose.
- `[PERMISSION_1],[PERMISSION_2],...`: A comma-separated list of permissions you want to include in the role.
- `[PROJECT_ID]`: The ID of your Google Cloud project.

### Example

```bash
gcloud iam roles create MyCustomRole \
  --project="my-project" \
  --title="My Custom Role" \
  --description="Custom role for specific permissions" \
  --permissions="storage.buckets.get,storage.objects.list" \
  --stage="GA"
```

### 4. **Assign Custom Role to the Service Account**

After creating the custom role, you can assign it to the service account just like you did with predefined roles:

```bash
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding my-project \
  --member='serviceAccount:my-service-account@my-project.iam.gserviceaccount.com' \
  --role='projects/my-project/roles/MyCustomRole'
```

### Summary

- **Predefined Roles**: You can use predefined roles that Google Cloud provides.
- **Custom Roles**: If predefined roles don't meet your needs, you can create custom roles with specific permissions.

This way, you have the flexibility to assign either predefined or custom roles to your service accounts based on your access control requirements.


## after creation can we grab it's name



Yes, after creating a Service Account (SA), you can retrieve its details, including its name and email, using the `gcloud` command-line tool. Here are a couple of ways to grab the service account information:

### 1. **List All Service Accounts**

To list all service accounts in a specific project, you can use the following command:

```bash
gcloud iam service-accounts list --project="[PROJECT_ID]"
```

### Replace the placeholder:
- `[PROJECT_ID]`: The ID of your Google Cloud project.

### Example

```bash
gcloud iam service-accounts list --project="my-project"
```

This command will return a list of service accounts, including their names and emails. The output will look something like this:

```
DISPLAY NAME                  EMAIL                                          DISABLED
---------------------------  ---------------------------------------------  ---------
My Service Account           my-service-account@my-project.iam.gserviceaccount.com  False
```

### 2. **Get Details of a Specific Service Account**

If you want to get detailed information about a specific service account you just created, you can use the following command:

```bash
gcloud iam service-accounts describe [SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL]
```

### Replace the placeholder:
- `[SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL]`: The email of the service account (e.g., `my-service-account@my-project.iam.gserviceaccount.com`).

### Example

```bash
gcloud iam service-accounts describe my-service-account@my-project.iam.gserviceaccount.com
```

This command will provide detailed information about the specified service account, including its creation date, display name, and more.

### Summary

Using the above commands, you can easily retrieve the name and email of the service accounts you have created in your Google Cloud project.
