difference between , 

```gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding ${PROJECT_ID} \
  --member="serviceAccount:${SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL}" \
  --role="roles/compute.admin" 
```

and 

```gcloud iam service-accounts add-iam-policy-binding "${SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL}" \ 
--project="${GCP_PROJECT_ID}" \
--role="roles/iam.workloadIdentityUser" \
--member="principalSet://iam.googleapis.com/projects/${GCP_PROJECT_NUMBER}/locations/global/workloadIdentityPools/k8s-pool/attribute.repository/${GITHUB_REPO}"
```

The two `gcloud` commands you've provided serve different purposes in the context of Google Cloud IAM, specifically regarding how permissions and roles are assigned. Here's a breakdown of each command and their differences:

### 1. **First Command: Adding IAM Policy Binding to a Project**

```bash
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding ${PROJECT_ID} \
  --member="serviceAccount:${SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL}" \
  --role="roles/compute.admin"
```

- **Purpose**: This command assigns the `roles/compute.admin` role to a service account at the project level.
- **Scope**: 
  - The **scope** of this command is the **project** specified by `${PROJECT_ID}`.
  - It allows the specified service account to perform actions related to Google Compute Engine resources within that project, such as managing instances, disks, and networks.
- **Member Type**: 
  - The `--member` flag specifies a service account (`serviceAccount:${SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL}`) as the principal that will receive the role.
- **Usage Context**: This command is typically used when you want a service account to have specific permissions across the project level.

### 2. **Second Command: Adding IAM Policy Binding to a Service Account for Workload Identity**

```bash
gcloud iam service-accounts add-iam-policy-binding "${SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL}" \
  --project="${GCP_PROJECT_ID}" \
  --role="roles/iam.workloadIdentityUser" \
  --member="principalSet://iam.googleapis.com/projects/${GCP_PROJECT_NUMBER}/locations/global/workloadIdentityPools/k8s-pool/attribute.repository/${GITHUB_REPO}"
```

- **Purpose**: This command assigns the `roles/iam.workloadIdentityUser` role to a service account, allowing it to act on behalf of a GitHub repository within a specific workload identity pool.
- **Scope**:
  - The **scope** of this command is specifically the **service account** defined by `${SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL}`.
  - It enables the service account to use Workload Identity Federation, allowing it to authenticate to Google Cloud services as if it were the user or service running in GitHub.
- **Member Type**: 
  - The `--member` flag specifies a **principal set**, which represents an external identity (in this case, a GitHub repository) that can impersonate the service account. The format `principalSet://...` is used for Workload Identity Federation.
- **Usage Context**: This command is used when you want to allow external identities (like those from GitHub) to authenticate as the service account, facilitating secure access to Google Cloud resources without needing to manage service account keys.

### Key Differences

1. **Scope of Role Assignment**:
   - The first command assigns permissions at the project level for the service account to manage Compute Engine resources.
   - The second command allows external identities (specifically from GitHub) to impersonate the service account through Workload Identity Federation.

2. **Principal Type**:
   - The first command uses a service account as the principal directly.
   - The second command uses a principal set, which is an external identity that is allowed to use the service account.

3. **Role Assigned**:
   - The first command assigns the `roles/compute.admin` role, which is specific to managing Compute Engine resources.
   - The second command assigns the `roles/iam.workloadIdentityUser` role, which is necessary for allowing external identities to impersonate the service account.

### Summary

In essence, the first command is about granting a service account permissions within a project, while the second command is about allowing external identities to impersonate a service account through Workload Identity Federation. Each command serves a distinct purpose in managing access and permissions within Google Cloud IAM.

> ## both commands works hand in hand or are redundant?



The two commands you provided are not redundant; instead, they work together to achieve different aspects of access control and authentication within Google Cloud. Hereâ€™s how they complement each other:

### 1. **First Command: Assigning Project-Level Role to the Service Account**

```bash
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding ${PROJECT_ID} \
  --member="serviceAccount:${SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL}" \
  --role="roles/compute.admin"
```

- **Purpose**: This command grants the specified service account (`${SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL}`) the ability to perform actions related to Compute Engine resources within the specified project (`${PROJECT_ID}`).
- **Use Case**: You use this command when you want the service account itself to have permissions to manage Compute Engine resources directly. This could be necessary for automated tasks or services that need to interact with GCP resources.

### 2. **Second Command: Allowing External Identity to Impersonate the Service Account**

```bash
gcloud iam service-accounts add-iam-policy-binding "${SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL}" \
  --project="${GCP_PROJECT_ID}" \
  --role="roles/iam.workloadIdentityUser" \
  --member="principalSet://iam.googleapis.com/projects/${GCP_PROJECT_NUMBER}/locations/global/workloadIdentityPools/k8s-pool/attribute.repository/${GITHUB_REPO}"
```

- **Purpose**: This command allows a specific external identity (e.g., a GitHub repository) to impersonate the service account. This is useful for Workload Identity Federation, which enables external identities to authenticate as Google Cloud service accounts without the need for service account keys.
- **Use Case**: You use this command when you want to enable an external service (like GitHub Actions) to act on behalf of the service account. This is particularly useful for CI/CD pipelines where external repositories need to access GCP resources.

### How They Work Together

- **Complementary Roles**: The first command enables the service account to manage Compute Engine resources directly, while the second command allows an external identity (e.g., a GitHub repo) to authenticate as that service account. 
- **Secure Access**: By allowing an external identity to impersonate the service account, you maintain secure access without hardcoding service account keys or credentials, promoting best practices for security.

### Example Scenario

Imagine a scenario where you have a CI/CD pipeline running in GitHub Actions that needs to deploy applications to Google Cloud:

1. **First Command**: You would use the first command to give the service account the necessary permissions to create and manage resources in Google Compute Engine.
2. **Second Command**: Then, you would use the second command to allow the GitHub repository (the CI/CD pipeline) to impersonate that service account, enabling it to perform those actions during deployment without managing service account keys.

### Summary

In summary, the two commands serve distinct purposes and work hand-in-hand to create a more flexible and secure environment for managing access to Google Cloud resources. One provides direct permissions to the service account, while the other allows external identities to authenticate as that service account, facilitating seamless interactions between external services and Google Cloud.
