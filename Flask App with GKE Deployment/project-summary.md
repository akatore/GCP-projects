### Overview
The guide outlines the steps to create and deploy a Flask application on GKE, a managed Kubernetes service on Google Cloud Platform (GCP). It covers creating a Flask app, containerizing it with Docker, pushing the image to Google Artifact Registry, and deploying it on GKE.

### Steps to Deploy Flask App on GKE

1. **Create a Flask Application:**
   - Develop a simple Flask app and ensure it's ready to be containerized.
   - Example code for a basic Flask app is provided.

2. **Build a Docker Image:**
   - Create a Dockerfile to define the app's environment and dependencies.
   - Build the Docker image using the `docker build` command.

3. **Push the Image to Google Artifact Registry:**
   - Create a Docker repository in Google Artifact Registry.
   - Enable the required API and push the Docker image to the registry using the `docker push` command.
   - Instructions on tagging the image correctly are included.

4. **Create a GKE Cluster:**
   - Enable the GKE API.
   - Create a new GKE cluster and connect to it using `gcloud` commands.
   - Verify that the cluster is operational and check the compute instances.

5. **Create a Kubernetes Deployment:**
   - Create a deployment manifest to define how the Flask app should run in the cluster.
   - Expose the deployment via a LoadBalancer service to make it accessible from the internet.

6. **Access the Application:**
   - Obtain the external IP address of the LoadBalancer to access the Flask app in a browser.
   - Verify that both the main and about pages of the app are working correctly.

7. **Clean Up Resources:**
   - Delete the Kubernetes service and deployment.
   - Remove the repository from Google Artifact Registry and disable any APIs that were enabled during the process.

### Conclusion
Following these steps allows users to efficiently deploy scalable, cloud-native web applications using Flask and GKE. The guide emphasizes proper tagging and pushing of Docker images, as well as managing resources effectively in GCP.
